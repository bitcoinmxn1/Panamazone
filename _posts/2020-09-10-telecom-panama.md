## Telephony

Movistar and Cable & Wireless are the two largest telephone providers in Panama. Movistar was the first mobile phone provider while CWP acquired the state-owned fixed-line company to then offer mobile phones as well. Years later Digicel and Claro arrived and because of this they have fewer users, Cable Onda because it is a cable TV provider eventually started offering fixed telephony as well.
