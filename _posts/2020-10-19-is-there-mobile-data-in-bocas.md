A user asked:
> On November 2nd I'm going away for a week and I need to know if there's any data for my cell phone so I'll have to be online since theoretically, I should be working.
> I am with tigo/movistar and i am 95% sure that the signal does not arrive even with a satellite dish but maybe there are other companies that do... any recommendation?
> thanks in advance

In places where the population is concentrated mostly Changuinola type, Admiral or Columbus Island you will not have major problems with any phone company, outside it is very possible that you will run out of signal. The last time I went there, I was a digicel and I didn't have a signal until I got to a densely populated place and my dad, who was a +mobile, had a signal almost all the time in the places where we went.
