For anyone here in Panama, it is very difficult to get a PC already built to the specifications I am looking for, so I built my own. I believe that it is the most recommendable thing.

I would say that you should also check PC Part Picker, itâ€™s an address where you can look for the parts you are interested in and at once it indicates if the parts are sharable, if not, it gives you suggestions to solve the problem of sharing.

Afterwards, have the parts shipped via a P.O. box in Miami, in which here is a [link on reliable shippers](https://panama-zone.com/online-shopping-po-box-panama).
