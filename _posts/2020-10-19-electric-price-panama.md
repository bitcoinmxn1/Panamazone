There are several rates, so there is no fixed cost per kwh. There are 5 BT (Low Voltage) rates There is the BTS (S: Simple) which is subdivided into 3: BTS1, BTS2, BTS3. The BTD (D: with Demand) and BTH (H: Hourly). For residences, the first 4 apply and the way of being in one of them is automatically calculated by your consumption.
