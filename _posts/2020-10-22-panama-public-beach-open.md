Through Resolution No. 1260 of October 20, the Ministry of Health (Minsa) authorized the reactivation, operation and mobilization of family recreational activities in the areas of beaches and rivers.

The entrance to the beaches and rivers throughout the country will only be from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and for family recreational activities.

Only family groups with a maximum of seven people will be allowed. Therefore, no buses or other means of transportation will be allowed to transport people in a massive way.

No person will be allowed access with four Covid-19 suggestive, who are positive, who have been swabbed and are waiting for the results or who are contacts of positive cases of the disease.

Visitors to beaches and rivers must wear masks and may only remove them when in their family bubble and when in the water.

Within the resolution it is highlighted that health authorities and in coordination with security authorities may carry out tests to detect the virus at the entrances of beaches and rivers.
