They lost 2 out of 4 helicopters and 4 men were wounded out of 23~ during the operation, they succeeded but it didn’t go very well all things considered.

They got very very lucky the VIP didn’t die when his helicopter was shot down.

katsgegg | 3 days ago | 3 points I found this podcast, that tells the story of how all this started. I have only heard 1 episode, and to be clear is from only the perspective of the FBI agent where this all started in a squeezy bar in the States.
