I expect answers!

> I share data to everything that needs internet at home, I don't have another internet provider.
> It works great, I've downloaded gigs and gigs of data and it's not limited.
> I live in the center of the city, I throw 20 megas symmetrical, which is enough for what I need.

> Mas Movil out I tell you it is not unlimited. Precisely I asked that question in their store and they told me that in the $40 contract the limit is 100GB per month, since no customer of theirs exceeds that amount of GB per month, after you exceed 100GB you receive 3G data until the cycle is renewed. Of course this is the only one that is unlimited as far as I know.
